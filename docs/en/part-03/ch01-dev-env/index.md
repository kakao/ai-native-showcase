# Chapter 1. Development environment and evaluation system

No matter how powerful a platform is, it's difficult to fully unleash AI's potential if the "development environment" developers face daily isn't organically integrated with AI. This is because, regardless of how advanced an intelligent platform becomes, its full potential cannot be realized unless developers can easily utilize its functions and collaborate seamlessly with AI within their daily work environment.

If we want to overcome the limitations of "vibe coding" and meet the requirements of complex software development, the importance of AI-based workflows becomes paramount. This signifies that AI must move beyond piecemeal code generation or specific functional assistance to become the core of an 'innovative development environment' that encompasses the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). 

These workflows are essential for improving software quality and integrating AI into various development activities that occur outside the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Kakao's efforts to enhance the development environment through AI integration have already been thoroughly explored in Part 2. In this chapter, we will discuss how Kakao evaluates AI's impact across the SDLC stages within its development environments.

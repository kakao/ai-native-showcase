No matter how sophisticated AI technology, intelligent platform systems, and innovative development environments may be, their value is bound to be halved if not supported by the competencies and culture of those who use them. Just as much as it invests in AI technology introduction, system construction, and evaluation, Kakao is heavily investing in strengthening all members' ability to use AI and fostering a culture of natural collaboration with AI.

This chapter specifically discusses how Kakao has designed and cultivated an AI collaboration culture suited to the AI era. It is built upon key elements such as "an open mind to accept AI as a colleague," "a spirit of continuous learning and experimentation," "transparent communication and knowledge sharing," and "the pursuit of ethical responsibility and human-centered values."

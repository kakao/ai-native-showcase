# 2.2. AI collaboration cheat sheet and 'standard ruleset sharing system' that add practicality

Kakao created and distributed a separate “AI Collaboration Cheat Sheet” to allow developers to quickly and easily reference the guidebook's core philosophy and extensive practices during work. This cheat sheet is designed to fit the most frequent situations developers face by compressing only the key principles and essential prompting techniques onto a single page. It's meant to be placed next to a desk or monitor for immediate use at any time.

Furthermore, to more systematically apply the guidebook's principles to actual development tools, we are building an internal system that allows anyone to easily share and reference the “AI Coding Agent Standard Ruleset” and best prompt practices. 

This enables developers to easily search for configuration files optimized for specific AI tools/environments (e.g., 'Cursor Rule', 'Claude Memory') or prompt examples demonstrating high performance for specific tasks in a centralized repository, and apply them to their own development environment.

Through this system, Kakao's coding conventions and standard rulesets containing security policies are applied consistently across the enterprise, while creating a virtuous cycle in which creative and efficient prompt know-how discovered in the business is voluntarily accumulated and disseminated.

If an "Agentic Coding Guidebook" acts as a "textbook" for AI collaboration, the "Cheat Sheet" and "Ruleset Sharing System" function as a "practical tool kit" and a "collective intelligence platform" that can be used immediately at the development site.

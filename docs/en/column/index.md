# Column

In-depth coverage of real-world experiences and success stories from our AI-native transformation journey.

This section shares concrete achievements and lessons learned as Kakao applies AI to actual work based on the 'agent-based reengineering' philosophy. Through field-tested cases rather than theory, we demonstrate how AI can bring substantial innovation to real work.

- **Open Source Verification Automation**: Improving the OLIVE system's verification process using MCP
- **License Analysis AI Agent**: Building an LLM-based legal review automation system

Each case provides practical insights for those looking to apply AI in their work, covering everything from problem identification to solution process and actual results.

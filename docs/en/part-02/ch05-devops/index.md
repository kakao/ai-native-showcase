Traditionally, deployment and operations have been characterized by complex, manual tasks, unpredictable failures, and tremendous strain on operations teams who must maintain a 24-hour state of alert. It is a nightmare that many developers and operators have experienced at least once: a service developed with great ambition becomes useless due to a small mistake in the deployment process, or collapses helplessly due to a sudden increase in traffic.

However, AI has brought about significant changes to these deployment and operating environments. By enabling intelligent judgment and prediction beyond simple automation, Kakao's DevOps culture is accelerating and taking service stability to a new level. This chapter examines how AI resolves the complexity of deployment and operational environments and contributes to the continuous stability of services and the achievement of efficient business results.

This chapter consists of two topics. First, we will discuss how AI is integrated into the entire release management process, from planning to execution and monitoring, to enable safe and efficient deployment, using actual examples from Kakao Release. Next, we explore how AI can be used to make monitoring, which is essential to service operation, more intelligent and automate the entire process from problem detection to root cause analysis and action recommendations.

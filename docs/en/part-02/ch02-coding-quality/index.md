# Chapter 2. AI-based coding and code quality management

In the past, developers typed countless lines of code and repeated endless searches and trial-and-error to resolve complex errors. Repetitive tasks and inefficiency had long been considered inevitable. However, AI is now evolving beyond a simple tool to become an intelligent pair programmer and agent that understands developers' thinking and work, collaborating proactively. These changes go beyond mere convenience and are fundamentally transforming the very paradigm of development productivity.

This chapter consists of four topics. 

First, we will learn about "Vibe Coding," a new development method that implements ideas at overwhelming speeds through organic collaboration between AI and human developers, focusing on actual cases and useful prompt patterns. 

Next, we will discuss how AI editors such as GitHub Copilot are improving productivity in actual development environments, and present the evolution of AI editors and various utilization strategies. Then, we will take an in-depth look at refactoring methodologies that utilize AI to improve existing code safely and efficiently from the perspective of "Human-Driven Development (HDD)." 

Finally, we explain how AI-based static analysis, bug prediction, and automated test generation technologies are revolutionizing code quality and bringing positive changes to development culture through specific technical approaches and examples.

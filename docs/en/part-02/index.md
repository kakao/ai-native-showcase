# Execute: Developing with AI - SDLC full collaboration case study

This part explores how Kakao integrates and utilizes AI throughout the entire software development process. 

Our goal is to maximize productivity and ultimately transform ideas into reality at overwhelming speed. To achieve this, Kakao has set a vision of "agent-based reengineering" and is working to implement it through the construction of an E2E (End-to-End) intelligent development environment. 

This goes beyond merely introducing individual AI tools; we aim to create an environment where the entire development process is intelligently automated by AI.

| phase 1: Acceleration of development work | phase 2: Pre/Post Process Expansion | phase 3: System integration |
|---|---|---|
| AI-powered code generation accelerates developers' core tasks (coding). | Beyond coding, we support the entire development process, from planning and design to review. | We seamlessly integrate AI into your existing development ecosystem (CI/CD, PM tools, etc.) to create a single system. |
| Work method:<br>1. Request: The developer asks the AI to generate code.<br>2. Judgment: The generated code is reviewed and modified by human developers.<br>3. Review: As before, a colleague (Human) reviews the final code. | Expanding the role of AI:<br>• Before development: Requirements analysis, functional specifications, and architecture design support<br>• After development: Analyze operational issues and propose solutions, assist in the review process (detect potential bugs, etc.) | Seamless workflow:<br>• AI works seamlessly within the development workflow, mediating interactions between humans and systems.<br>• Implement intelligent automation that triggers the next phases in the system based on human review and approval. |
| Core Values:<br>Immediate productivity gains | Core Values:<br>Strategic decision support and development cycle optimization | Core Values:<br>Complete E2E intelligent workflow |

PART 2 focuses on this roadmap and provides a detailed look at how AI is being used to innovate the development process.

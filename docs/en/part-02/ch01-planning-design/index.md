# Chapter 1. AI-based planning and design, development productivity

AI is evolving beyond a simple automation tool to become a strategic partner that broadens thinking and improves decision-making. However, to fully harness that potential, we need the wisdom to understand AI's characteristics and use it correctly. In this chapter, we will explore how AI can be utilized in the initial stages of setting the direction for a project to sharpen intuition and streamline repetitive tasks, using actual prompts and examples. It also covers how to solve the dilemma of uncertainty faced by AI development teams through AI-based rapid idea validation and development approaches, and how to efficiently achieve production-level results from prototypes.

You will experience how AI can go beyond being a simple assistant throughout the entire development process to become a core partner that sets the direction for "what to create" and maximizes efficiency in "how to create." At the same time, we will present essential precautions and principles for the wise use of AI, providing practical guidance to ensure the success of AI-based projects.
